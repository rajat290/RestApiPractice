📌 Official Definition (Technical)
When an API request is made, the server responds with a status code and data (usually in JSON format). API responses can be:

Successful (2xx) – The request was completed successfully.
Client Errors (4xx) – The request was incorrect or missing required data.
Server Errors (5xx) – Something went wrong on the server.
Handling API responses correctly ensures that our application behaves as expected, even if something goes wrong.

🧸 Explanation for a 5-Year-Old
Imagine you order a pizza 🍕:

If the pizza arrives hot and fresh, everything is great! ✅
If they bring the wrong pizza, it's a client error (your order was incorrect). ❌
If the pizza shop burns down, it's a server error (not your fault!). 🔥
Similarly, APIs respond with different status codes based on what happened.

🌍 Why is Handling API Responses Important?
✅ Prevents app crashes when an API fails.
✅ Shows helpful messages instead of a blank page.
✅ Improves user experience by handling slow responses properly.
✅ Helps developers debug errors easily.

🔹 Understanding API Response Status Codes
Status Code	Meaning	Example
200 OK	Success	Data retrieved successfully
201 Created	Success	New data added to the server
400 Bad Request	Client Error	Missing or incorrect request data
401 Unauthorized	Client Error	No permission (wrong API key, not logged in)
404 Not Found	Client Error	The requested resource doesn't exist
500 Internal Server Error	Server Error	The API is broken on the backend
