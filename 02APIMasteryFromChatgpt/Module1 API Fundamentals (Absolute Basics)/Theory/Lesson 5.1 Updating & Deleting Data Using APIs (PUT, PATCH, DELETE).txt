Lesson 5.1: Updating & Deleting Data Using APIs (PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

PUT REQUEST => it updates entire resource (object) in Api 
PATCH REQUEST => it updates partial resource only specific fields (object) in Api
DELETE REQUEST => it deletes resource (object) in Api


Easy Explanation 
1️⃣ PUT → Imagine you have a drawing 🎨, and you completely redraw it.
2️⃣ PATCH → You only change the color of the hat 🎩 without redrawing the whole image.
3️⃣ DELETE → You erase the drawing 🗑️ completely.


Why is This Important?
✅ PUT & PATCH allow users to update their profiles, change product details, etc.
✅ DELETE helps in removing users, products, or unwanted data.
✅ Essential for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in applications.
