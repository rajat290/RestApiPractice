🔹 Lesson 1: What is an API?
📌 Official Definition (Technical)
An Api (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows two software applications to communicate with each other. it defines how requests and Response should be formatted so different systems can exchange data in a Structured way.

EASY Explanation
Imagine you’re at a restaurant 🍕.

You (the user) want a pizza.
The kitchen (server) makes the pizza, but you can’t go inside the kitchen.
So, you call the waiter (API), tell them what you want, and they bring you the pizza from the kitchen!
💡 The API is like the waiter—it takes your request to the server and brings back the response.
