json follows a key value pair


 Why is JSON Important in APIs?
âœ… Used by Almost Every API â†’ REST APIs return and accept JSON as the main data format.
âœ… Lightweight and Fast â†’ JSON is text-based, so it's quick to send and receive.
âœ… Easy to Read and Write â†’ Itâ€™s structured like JavaScript objects.
âœ… Works Across Programming Languages â†’ JSON is not limited to JavaScriptâ€”Python, Java, PHP, and other languages can read/write JSON.

ðŸ†š JSON vs JavaScript Object

ðŸ“Œ JSON Example:

{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Object:

const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  email: "john@example.com"
};


ðŸ’¡ Difference:

JSON must use double quotes (" ") around keys & strings.
JSON cannot contain functionsâ€”only data.
JSON is text-based, while JavaScript objects exist in memory.
