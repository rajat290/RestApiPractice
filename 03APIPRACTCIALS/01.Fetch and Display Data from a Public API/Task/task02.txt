Next Steps (For Your Practice)
Try replacing fetch() with axios.

 Practice Task 1: Replace fetch() with axios
📌 Task Description:
Modify the previous code to use Axios instead of the Fetch API to get user data. Axios simplifies API requests by handling JSON conversion automatically.

📝 Task Explanation:
Axios is a third-party library that makes API calls easier and more readable.
Unlike fetch(), Axios automatically converts responses to JSON.
It provides better error handling and supports request timeouts.
💡 How This Helps You in Real-World Development
Many companies prefer Axios because of its built-in response handling.
It reduces boilerplate code (no need for response.json()).
It's widely used in large-scale applications.
🛠 Concepts Used
HTTP Requests with Axios
Handling API responses
React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

📚 Structured Learning Path
Before implementing Axios, make sure you understand:

JavaScript Promises (how .then() and .catch() work).
Differences Between Fetch and Axios (e.g., Axios handles errors better).
React Hooks (useState, useEffect).


Display additional user details (email, phone).
📌 Task Description:
Modify the previous component to show additional user details such as email and phone number.

📝 Task Explanation: =>

Every user has more details available in the API response.
You need to access and display email and phone.

💡 How This Helps You in Real-World Development
API responses contain multiple fields; understanding how to extract them is key.
Interviewers often ask candidates to display different fields dynamically.
Useful for dashboards, admin panels, and e-commerce product pages.

🛠 Concepts Used
Accessing API response properties.
Updating JSX dynamically.

📚 Structured Learning Path
To complete this task, review:

API Response Structure (understanding JSON objects).
How to Access Object Properties in JavaScript (object.property).
JSX Syntax for Rendering Dynamic Data (.map() method).
