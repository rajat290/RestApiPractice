Task: Fetch and Display Data from a Public API
📌 Task Description:
You need to fetch user data from the JSONPlaceholder API and display user names in a list. The API provides dummy user data, and your task is to retrieve and display it in a React component.

📝 Task Explanation:
APIs provide structured data, but fetching and displaying that data in the UI is a crucial skill for any React developer. In this task, you'll use the fetch() method (or Axios) to retrieve data from an API and display it dynamically.

This will involve:

Fetching data from an API using fetch().
Using React state (useState) to store the API response.
Using React effects (useEffect) to trigger the API call on component mount.
Rendering data dynamically using the .map() function
